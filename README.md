# Flowable UI Client

A lightweight and modern web interface for **Flowable REST APIs (v7.x)**.  
Built with **React + Vite**, this client allows you to explore process definitions, start new process instances, manage user tasks, and monitor runtime state ‚Äî directly from a clean web UI.

---

## ‚ú® Features
- View **process definitions** and their versions  
- Start **process instances** with variables  
- Inspect **active instances**, variables and incidents  
- Manage **user tasks** (claim, complete, open details)  
- **Pagination** and filters for tasks and instances  
- Layout inspired by **Flowable Work UI**

---

## üîó Compatibility
| Component | Version |
|------------|----------|
| Flowable Engine | 7.x |
| Flowable REST base | `/flowable-rest/service` |
| Node.js | ‚â• 18 |
| NPM | ‚â• 9 |
| TypeScript | ‚â• 5 |

---

## üöÄ Quick start

```bash
# Install deps
npm install

# Configure env
cp .env.example .env
# then edit VITE_API_BASE to point to your Flowable REST (e.g. http://localhost:8080/flowable-rest/service)

# Start dev
npm run dev
````

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)

> üß© **Note:** By default, the app works *without any proxy*.
> If your Flowable REST API runs on the same origin or already supports CORS, you don‚Äôt need to modify anything.

---

## üß∞ Optional dev proxy (for CORS issues)

If you get CORS errors during development because your Flowable REST API runs on a **different origin**
(e.g. backend on port 8080 and UI on 5173), you can enable the commented proxy block in `vite.config.ts`.

Example file (included by default):

```ts
// vite.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  server: {
    /*
     * Optional: Flowable REST dev proxy
     * Uncomment this block only if you get CORS issues
     * when connecting to a Flowable REST API running on a different origin.
     */
    // proxy: {
    //   '/flowable-rest': {
    //     target: 'http://localhost:8080',
    //     changeOrigin: true,
    //     secure: false,
    //   },
    // },
  },
})
```

> üí° Just uncomment the `proxy` section and restart `npm run dev` to bypass CORS locally.

---

## üê≥ Docker

Build a production image and run with Nginx:

```bash
docker build -t dockerlmontag/flowable-ui-client:latest .
docker run -p 8080:80 dockerlmontag/flowable-ui-client:latest
```

Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security & CORS

This project is a **client** for Flowable REST.
CORS must be configured **on the server side** (Flowable REST) or via a **reverse proxy** in production.
During local development, you can temporarily use the Vite dev proxy as shown above.

---

## üì¶ Versioning

The package version is aligned to **7.0.0** to indicate compatibility with Flowable 7.x APIs.
